# Dihedral Angle and Ground Clearance (Part 3 p. 211)

This note summarizes the guidance from **Airplane Design Part 3** on
computing the wing dihedral angle and evaluating ground clearance.

## Computing Dihedral Angle

The text proposes choosing a baseline dihedral angle of **3°** for an
unswept mid‑wing. Adjustments are then made according to sweep and wing
placement:

- Reduce the angle by **1° for every 10°** of quarter‑chord sweep.
- For **high‑wing** airplanes subtract **2°** and for **low‑wing**
  airplanes add **2°**.

Example 8.4 applies these rules for a low‑wing with 26° sweep, resulting
in a dihedral angle of approximately **2.3°**.

## Ground Clearance Considerations

A positive dihedral raises the wing tip and any wing‑mounted engine or
propeller. When landing on one wheel with a bank angle, this extra height
improves clearance. The text notes that a **minimum ground clearance
angle of 8°** is desirable, with more margin preferred for safe
maneuvering. Increasing the dihedral can lower landing‑gear height and
mass on a low‑wing aircraft, so selecting a slightly higher dihedral than
the baseline may be justified.

## Assignment 8.7

- **Compute** the dihedral angle using the above guidelines.
- **Evaluate** whether additional dihedral is needed for ground
  clearance and determine a final angle accordingly.
