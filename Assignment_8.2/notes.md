# Wing Taper Ratio Guidance

This summary is based on Part 3 p.189 of **Airplane Design**.

- **Definition**: The taper ratio \(\lambda\) is the tip chord divided by the root chord.
- **Manufacturing**: A rectangular planform (\(\lambda = 1\)) simplifies rib geometry and joints, lowering cost. Tapering increases manufacturing effort.
- **Lift Distribution**: Reducing tip chord shifts lift inboard. Combined with sweep, taper alters how lift varies along the span and therefore affects induced drag.
- **Induced Drag**: With no sweep, a taper ratio near 0.4 produces an almost elliptical lift distribution, minimizing induced drag.
- **Structural Mass**: Concentrating area at the root lowers bending moments and increases the airfoil thickness at the root, allowing lighter spar caps and skins.
- **Tip Stall**: Thinner tip chords stall sooner, particularly with sweep, which can reduce aileron effectiveness.
- **Typical Values**: Propeller aircraft show taper ratios from about 0.35 to 0.8. Greater sweep angles tend to coincide with lower taper ratios.
- **Trend Line**: A simple relationship relating sweep angle to taper ratio is suggested:
  \[
  \lambda \approx 0.2\left(2 - \frac{\Lambda_{c/4}}{180}\right),
  \]
  where \(\Lambda_{c/4}\) is the quarterâ€“chord sweep in degrees. This yields \(\lambda = 0.4\) for zero sweep.
- **Design Choice**: Any value between 0 and 1 is possible; the designer must weigh drag, structure and stall behavior in selecting \(\lambda\).
