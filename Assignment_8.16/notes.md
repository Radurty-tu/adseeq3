Part 3 page 226 discusses how under-wing jet engines are mounted using a pylon connecting the nacelle to the wing box.
Key points include:
- **Lateral positioning**: Outboard placement relieves wing bending but increases yawing moment in an engine-out case. Typical lateral positions are 35% of semi-span for one engine per wing half, or 40% and 70% when two per wing half.
- **Longitudinal positioning**: Rotating parts should be kept ahead of the front spar to mitigate turbine disk failure risks. The engine should sit as far forward as practical to reduce aerodynamic interference, while remaining close to the wing box to minimize pylon mass.
- **Vertical positioning**: Moving the engine closer to the wing increases aerodynamic interference but improves ground clearance. Lower engines may require taller landing gear, whereas higher placement shortens the moment arm between thrust vector and center of gravity, reducing pitching moment.

Example 8.15 illustrates these principles by integrating a sample nacelle with the wing in top, front and side views. The assignment that follows (8.16) instructs designers to integrate their own under-wing engine(s) in these three views and to mark the pylon location in the front view.
