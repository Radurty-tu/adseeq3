# Fuselage Side View Design (Part 3 p.134)

The design of the fuselage side view combines the cross-section and top-view layouts with
three main requirements:

* **Emergency evacuation** – exit doors must comply with the relevant regulations.
* **Pilot visibility** – the cockpit must offer unobstructed forward and upward vision.
* **Ground clearance** – enough clearance is needed to avoid tail strikes and nacelle contact.

The book proposes a nine‑step sequence for drawing the side view. Key steps related to the
above requirements include:

1. Determine fuselage height using the cross‑section.
2. Copy nose‑cone and tail‑cone locations from the top view.
3. Locate the flight deck and draw main and lower deck floors.
4. Set the pilot eye position and sketch the visibility angles.
5. Choose an upsweep angle for the tail cone and set the nose point height.
6. Draw the crown and belly curves.
7. Scale and locate passenger doors to meet emergency‑exit rules.

### Example angles

Example 6.7 illustrates how these steps apply. The pilot’s eye is placed 1 m behind the start
of the flight deck and 1.1 m above it, with a **20° over‑nose angle** and a **25° upward view**.
A **4° upsweep angle** is selected for the tail cone. The cockpit windshield uses a
**25° grazing angle**. For a 180‑passenger layout, two pairs of Type B exits and one pair of
Type III exits are drawn along the cabin.

These choices satisfy visibility and tail‑clearance targets while meeting evacuation spacing
requirements.
