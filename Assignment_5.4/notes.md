# Propulsion System Efficiencies (Part 2 pp. 90-91)

This section introduces how the bypass ratio of a turbofan influences fuel consumption and explains how to choose efficiency values for different propulsion types.

* **Turbofan TSFC relation** – For cruise conditions the thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) depends on the bypass ratio B. Using published data the following relation applies for 1 ≤ B ≤ 15:

  \[\text{TSFC} = 22 B^{-0.19} \;[\text{g}/\text{kN}/\text{s}]\]

  This allows estimating the jet efficiency via Eq. (5.21). Increasing B generally improves efficiency but makes the engine diameter larger.

* **Assignment 5.4 inputs** – To evaluate propulsion performance provide the following according to the engine type:
  - If using an **electric motor**, assume a motor efficiency \(\eta_{em}\).
  - For **piston or turboprop engines**, assume a (thermal) engine efficiency \(\eta_{eng}\).
  - When a **propeller** is present, specify the propulsive efficiency \(\eta_p\).
  - For **turbofan engines**, select a bypass ratio B and compute the resulting jet efficiency \(\eta_j\).

These values are needed for later calculations of range and energy usage.
