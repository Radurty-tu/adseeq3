# Nacelle Sizing Assignment Summary

This summary is based on **Part 3 p.â€¯223** of the design notes. Assignment 8.15 focuses on computing dimensions for a turbofan engine nacelle and creating a scaled drawing. Key instructions include:

- Select a cowl fraction \(\phi\) for the nacelle. If the nacelle type is **B**, then \(\phi = 1\).
- Follow the sizing procedure from Example 8.14 to determine:
  - Inlet/highlight diameter \(D_h = D_i\)
  - Nacelle length \(l_n\)
  - Fan cowling length \(l_f = \phi l_n\)
  - Location of maximum diameter at \(\beta l_f\)
  - Maximum diameter \(D_n\)
  - Fan cowl exit diameter \(D_{ef}\)
  - Gas-turbine cowling diameter at the fan cowl exit \(D_g\)
  - Gas-turbine exit diameter \(D_{eg}\)
  - Cone diameter \(D_c\) and length \(l_c\)
- Record these values in a table for reference.
- Draw the nacelle outline using the computed dimensions. Apply the same drawing scale used for previous fuselage and wing assignments.
