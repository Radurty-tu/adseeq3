# Propulsion System Selection and Integration (Part 1 pp.61-62)

## Key Points
- Different engine counts and mounting locations each bring distinct trade-offs.
- **Single propeller** aircraft normally use a nose-mounted tractor arrangement for best propeller efficiency. A rear pusher needs a foreplane and shifts the wing aft.
- **Twin propeller** designs commonly mount engines below the wing in tractor configuration. An inline tractor/pusher pair reduces yawing moment after an engine failure but complicates landing gear and tail integration.
- **More than two propellers** are usually wing mounted. Four engines lessen thrust loss after an engine outage and may be required when individual engines lack sufficient power. Distributed propulsion with many small motors can ease landing gear design and maintain efficiency.
- **Jet engines** may be wing mounted or fuselage mounted. Wing mounting lightens bending loads but introduces aerodynamic interference and debris ingestion risk. Fuselage mounting gives a clean wing and smaller yawing/pitching effects but increases wing structural mass and may need a raised tail. Over‑the‑wing installations permit short landing gear yet require careful aero‑structural design.

## Assignment 4.3 Questions
a. What propulsion system do you choose for your airplane? Why?

b. What is the cruise speed or cruise Mach number of your airplane?

c. How many engines/motors have you selected for your design? Please, motivate this decision.

d. How do you intend to integrate the engines/motors with your airframe? Why do you choose this integration solution?

e. For propeller airplanes, how do you intend to comply with blade failure requirements for the chosen configuration? See Example 3.19 for more details on blade failure.

f. For turbine engines, how do you intend to comply with turbine-disk failure requirements for your chosen configuration? See Example 3.18 for more details on turbine-disk failure.

g. Has the integration of the propulsion system changed your design decision regarding the wing configuration? If so, explain.
