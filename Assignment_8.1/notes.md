# Wing Sweep Angle Guidance (Part 3 p.188)

From Part 3 of *Airplane Design* the recommended quarter‑chord sweep angle depends on the airplane's cruise Mach number:

- **Below Mach 0.66**: no sweep is required.
- **Above Mach 0.66**: apply increasing sweep to delay compressibility effects. For instance at a cruise Mach number of 0.78 a sweep of about 25° is suggested.

The cruise Mach number is computed from the cruise speed using the local speed of sound. Modern airfoils allow sufficient structural thickness without sweep at low Mach numbers. When Mach number exceeds roughly 0.66, sweep is used to keep the effective Mach number normal to the quarter chord below the critical value while providing enough wing volume for fuel and systems.
