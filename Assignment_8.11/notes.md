**Integration of Nose-Mounted Propellers with Cowlings**

Summary of *Airplane Design Part 3* page 212:

- The engine and propeller should be integrated into the nose of the fuselage in the top, side, and front views.
- A well-shaped engine cowling must be added to provide a smooth transition between the engine and fuselage surfaces.

These steps ensure the propeller installation is aerodynamically clean and fits within the overall fuselage design.
