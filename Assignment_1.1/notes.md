# Defining a Design Problem (Part 1 pp. 1-2)

These notes summarize the opening pages of *Airplane Design and Analysis* Part 1. The text outlines an eight‑step engineering design process. The first two pages focus on framing a design problem before exploring potential solutions.

## Key Ideas
- A clear design problem statement is essential. It defines what needs to be solved and may be broken down into smaller problems. Example: reducing greenhouse-gas emissions of regional travel.
- Requirements come from customers, regulations and suppliers. Specify only those relevant for the current phase.
- State a design objective to compare options, typically by minimizing or maximizing a performance metric.
- Brainstorm multiple design options, learning from past successes and failures. Consider functions first, then whether to adapt an existing design or create something original.

The text proposes the following guiding questions:

1. **What air transportation needs do you foresee in the near future?**
2. **What transportation need would you like to focus on during the course of this book?**
3. **If there are existing design solutions for these transportation needs, how do you want your design solution to distinguish itself from what is already existing?**
4. **Having answered these questions, write down your design problem statement.**【F:Assignment_1.1/notes.md†L1-L18】

If answering these questions is difficult, the authors suggest using an existing airplane as a basis. Designing a new airplane should surpass existing aircraft in cost or emissions when serving the same role. A brand‑new concept may target unmet needs but must still be attractive by keeping life‑cycle costs low.【F:Assignment_1.1/notes.md†L20-L22】

## Pros and Cons of a New Versus Existing Airplane
**Inventing a New Airplane**
- **Pros:** Can serve novel market needs; opportunity to reduce operating cost or emissions beyond current designs.
- **Cons:** Higher risk and development cost; market objectives may be less clear.

**Adapting an Existing Airplane**
- **Pros:** Easier to start from proven technology; existing data helps answer the design questions.
- **Cons:** Improvements may be limited; less freedom to address new requirements.

## Initial Design Problem Statement
*Example*: Rising demand for short-haul flights risks increasing global emissions. Develop a regional aircraft concept with substantially lower life‑cycle carbon footprint than current models while maintaining competitive operating costs.
