# Notes on CL_max Assumptions (Part 3 p.147)

Part 3 explains that selecting the wing's maximum lift coefficient for cruise (CL_max,CR), take‑off (CL_max,TO) and landing (CL_max,L) requires assuming plausible values before the high‑lift system is fully designed. Table 7.1 lists typical minimum and maximum CL_max values for several airplane types—homebuilts, single‑engine props, twin engines, business jets, regional turboprops and transport jets. These ranges help pick initial coefficients.

Key points:

- Landing configuration usually yields the highest CL_max, while cruise has the lowest. Take‑off settings fall between to balance added lift and the drag penalty of flaps.
- When choosing CL_max values, ensure that
  - CL_max,L ≥ CL_max,CR
  - CL_max,CR ≤ CL_max,TO ≤ CL_max,L.
- The chosen assumptions will later be refined once the high‑lift devices are specified in Chapter 10.

These assumed coefficients feed into sizing constraints, such as the stall speed requirement used in matching diagrams.
