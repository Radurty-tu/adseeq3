# Emergency Exit Requirements (Part 1 pp. 36-38)

The regulations in CS/FAR‑23 and CS/FAR‑25 require that passengers must be able to evacuate the aircraft within **90 seconds**. During conceptual design this requirement is addressed through rules on the number, type and distribution of exits.

## CS 23.807 Highlights
- At least one exit opposite the main passenger door for aircraft with two or more seats (excluding canopy aircraft).
- Exits must open from inside and outside and provide a clear opening of **48 × 66 cm**.
- Commuter aircraft require additional exits:
  - For up to 15 passengers, one exit per side.
  - For 16–19 passengers, three exits: one on the entry door side and two on the opposite side.

These limits ensure compliance with the 90‑second rule and guide fuselage layout early in design.

## CS 25.807 Highlights
- Exits must be **uniformly distributed** with floor-level exits near each end of the cabin when more than one per side is needed.
- No passenger exit may be more than **18.3 m** from the next exit on the same side.
- The allowed passenger capacity per exit depends on exit type. Table 1 summarizes the standard exit types and maximum passengers per side.

### Table 1 – Passenger capacity per exit type

| Exit Type | Max passengers (each side) |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Type A   | 110 |
| Type B   | 75 |
| Type C   | 55 |
| Type I   | 45 |
| Type II  | 40 |
| Type III | 35 |
| Type IV  | 9  |

Additional rules for seating configurations:
1. Up to 9 seats: one **Type IV** (or larger) exit per side, or at least a **Type III** if no over‑wing exits.
2. More than 9 seats: all exits must be **Type III** or larger.
3. 10–19 seats: at least one **Type III** (or larger) per side.
4. 20–40 seats: two exits per side, one being **Type II** or larger.
5. 41–110 seats: two exits per side, one being **Type I** or larger.
6. More than 110 seats: at least two **Type I** or larger per side.
7. Maximum combined seating for all Type III exits is **70**.
8. If Type A/B/C exits are installed, at least two Type C (or larger) exits are required per side.

## Impact on Fuselage Design
Determining exit number and location dictates fuselage structural openings, door mechanisms and seat layout. Designers must balance the required exit spacing with structural integrity and cabin arrangement, influencing fuselage length and window/door placement.
