# Landing Gear Integration (p.261 Part 3)

The text outlines a short procedure for setting the width (track) of the main landing gear and incorporating the gear in orthographic views:

1. **Select a suspension stroke** for the main landing gear along with the portion that is compressed under a 1‑g load.
2. **Determine the minimum lateral position** of each main strut to satisfy several constraints:
   - **Lateral turnover** requirement.
   - **Nacelle/propeller clearance** if the propulsion system is wing‑mounted.
   - **Tip clearance** at the wing tip.
   - **Engine clearance** for the fully compressed suspension with a deflated tire (wing‑mounted engines only).
3. **Integrate the gear in the front view**, showing retraction paths, any structural elements, and changes to the outer mold line as needed.
4. **Integrate the gear in the top view**, again indicating retraction paths, structural details, and any planform changes.

This sequence ensures that the landing gear layout provides adequate clearances and stability while fitting cleanly into the airplane’s overall geometry.
