# Notes on Energy Carrier Storage (Part 1 p.56)

## Deciding Where to Store the Energy Carrier
- Once the energy carrier has been selected, it must be integrated into the airframe. The two most common locations are the wing and the fuselage.
- **Wing tanks** utilize otherwise empty wing volume and reduce wing bending moments by providing bending moment relief, which can lower wing weight. This leads to the rule of thumb: *if the energy carrier can be stored in the wing, it should be stored in the wing*.
- **Fuselage tanks** may be necessary when wing storage is impracticalâ€”e.g., detachable wings on small aircraft or cryogenic fuels that require large pressurized tanks which cannot fit within the wing. External tanks under the wing are also an option.

## Initial Efficiency Assumptions for Cryogenic Fuels
- Cryogenic fuels require additional volume to allow fuel boil-off. The volumetric efficiency is therefore assumed to be $\eta_V = 0.85$.
- Tank mass significantly affects the usable energy. A gravimetric efficiency of $\eta_f = 0.4$ is assumed, meaning 40% of the tank-plus-fuel mass is fuel.
- These efficiencies lead to reduced effective specific energy and energy density for fuels like liquid hydrogen or LNG.
