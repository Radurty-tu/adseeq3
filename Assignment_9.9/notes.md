# Notes on Vertical Tailplane Design (Part 3 p.266)

Page 266 introduces **Assignment 9.9** which walks through sizing the vertical tailplane using the tail‑volume method and then drawing it in every view. The steps are:

1. Pick the longitudinal location of the vertical tail aerodynamic center.
2. Measure the moment arm `l_v` from this center to the aft CG.
3. Choose a volume coefficient and compute the tail area `S_v`.
4. Select aspect ratio `A_v`, taper ratio `λ_v` and leading‑edge sweep `Λ_{v,LE}`.
5. Derive span, root chord, tip chord and mean aerodynamic chord.
6. Place the vertical tail on the side view at the chosen location.
7. Add the tailplane to the front and top views as well.

A symmetric airfoil with a thickness ratio similar to the wing is adequate for now. Detailed airfoil design and integration with the horizontal tail are covered later in the course.
