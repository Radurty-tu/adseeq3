# Fuselage Cross-Section Design (Part 3 p.125)

This section provides an example-based method to size the fuselage cross-section. The design is illustrated with an eight-step sequence that starts from seat and aisle dimensions and finishes with the location of overhead bins. The steps are as follows:

1. **Set cabin dimensions** – Use eq. (6.5) along with Tables 6.2–6.3 to select the seat arrangement and aisle width. Compute cabin width $w_{\text{cabin}}$, floor width $w_{\text{floor}}$, and headroom width $w_{\text{headroom}}$ using eqs. (6.6)–(6.8). Record armrest, shoulder and headroom heights.
2. **Choose drawing scale** – Select the paper width and derive an appropriate scale (e.g. 1:20) based on $w_{\text{cabin}}$.
3. **Draw blocks** – Sketch rectangles for the seat rows and aisle. Add a symmetry line to indicate the center plane.
4. **Add floor depth** – Draw the passenger floor beneath the seats with the chosen floor depth.
5. **Insert cargo shape** – If required, draw the cargo container or luggage volume below the passenger floor.
6. **Fit an inner circle** – Enclose the seat blocks and cargo with the smallest possible circle. The circle diameter is $d_{f,\text{inner}}$.
7. **Determine outer diameter** – Apply eq. (6.3) to offset the circle by the wall thickness $t_{\text{wall}}$ and obtain $d_{f,\text{outer}}$. Measure deck heights $h_{\text{ld}}$ and $h_{\text{md}}$ from the lowest point.
8. **Trace overhead bins** – Draw a dashed line representing the overhead bin perimeter while maintaining aisle and headroom clearances.

The **perimeter length** of a circular fuselage section is the circumference of the outer circle, computed as
$$P_{\text{fus}} = \pi\, d_{f,\text{outer}}.$$
For a non-circular section the perimeter should be measured along the drawn outline.
