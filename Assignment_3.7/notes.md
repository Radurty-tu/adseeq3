# Climb-Gradient Requirements Summary

This note summarizes the discussion on climb-gradient regulations from *Airplane Design and Analysis Part 1* pages 35–36. The text introduces relevant certification paragraphs and explains which operating conditions must be logged when formulating these requirements for a new design.

## Referencing regulation paragraphs

The book lists the following paragraphs from CS/FAR regulations as the main sources for climb-gradient limits:

- **CS/FAR 23.65** – Climb performance with all engines operating.
- **CS/FAR 23.67** – One-engine-inoperative climb requirements.
- **CS/FAR 23.77** – Balked landing (go‑around) climb.
- **CS/FAR 25.111** – Take‑off path description.
- **CS/FAR 25.117** – General climb conditions.
- **CS/FAR 25.119** – Landing climb, all engines operating.
- **CS/FAR 25.121** – One-engine-inoperative climb during take‑off and approach.

The book explains that paragraph numbers in the text should be cited exactly (e.g. *“CS 25.119”* or *“CS/FAR 23.65”*) so that the reader can locate the corresponding section in the regulations.

## Information to record for each requirement

Assignment 3.7 asks the designer to note, for each applicable regulation paragraph, the required climb gradient together with these operating conditions:

1. **Weight** – typically either maximum take‑off mass \(m\_{MTO}\) or maximum landing mass \(m\_{ML}\).
2. **Thrust available** – expressed relative to the maximum thrust available (e.g. AEO or OEI power setting).
3. **Landing gear configuration** – whether the gear is extended (↓) or retracted (↑).
4. **Wing flap configuration** – configuration of the high‑lift devices (landing, take‑off, or cruise).

The text also highlights that multi‑engine airplanes must consider climb‑gradient tables for different numbers of engines (two, three or four), since regulations prescribe stricter gradients as the number of engines increases.
