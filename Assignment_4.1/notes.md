# Choosing an Energy Carrier

This summary covers the main points from **Part 1, page 55** of the course reader regarding selection and integration of the onboard energy source. Storing the energy in the wing is preferred when possible because the wing volume is usually not needed for payload, and wing tanks reduce bending moments on the structure. When wing storage is not feasible, the fuselage or external tanks may be used, especially for cryogenic fuels. The three broad energy carrier options are:

- **Conventional liquid fuel** (kerosene, avgas, diesel, etc.)
  - High mass-specific and volumetric energy.
  - Infrastructure and handling are well established.
  - Significant CO₂ and pollutant emissions.
- **Cryogenic fuel** (LH₂ or LNG)
  - Can lower or eliminate CO₂ emissions in operation.
  - Requires insulated pressurized tanks that add weight and take up volume.
  - Effective specific energy depends on tank efficiency.
- **Battery**
  - Very efficient conversion to propulsion power and no emissions in flight.
  - Mass does not decrease with discharge and charging is slow.
  - Needs thermal management and cannot be fully discharged.

Placeholder values from Table 4.1 illustrate the relative magnitude of specific energy (MJ/kg):

| Energy carrier       | Spec. energy (MJ/kg) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Jet A               | ~43                 |
| LH₂ (physical)      | ~120                |
| LNG                 | ~49                 |
| Biofuel/kerosene    | ~44                 |
| Li‑ion battery      | ~1.1                |

These figures show why hydrocarbon fuels remain attractive from a performance perspective. Cryogenic fuels and batteries offer environmental benefits but come with integration challenges. The location of the tanks or battery packs has a large influence on the airplane configuration and structure.
