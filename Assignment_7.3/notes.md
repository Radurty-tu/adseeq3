# Adding Landing Field Length Constraint

Summary from *Airplane Design Part 3*, page 153:

- Equation (7.15) provides the maximum wing loading allowed by the landing-field-length requirement. The parameters involved are the landing distance `LFL`, altitude `h`, temperature deviation `ΔT`, and the mass ratio `β`.
- Example 7.4 demonstrates applying this formula for propeller and jet aircraft, yielding respective limits on `W_TO/S_w`.
- Figures 7.7 and 7.8 show matching diagrams with the new landing-field-length constraint lines for both aircraft types.
- The assignment steps are:
  1. State `LFL`, `h`, `ΔT`, and `β` for your own aircraft.
  2. Compute the corresponding air density `ρ`.
  3. Calculate the maximum wing loading implied by the landing field length.
  4. Add this constraint to your matching diagram and determine the resulting maximum wing loading.
