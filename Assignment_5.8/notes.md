# Payload-Range Diagram Notes (Part 2 p.103)

The text on p.103 continues the discussion on constructing the payload–range
(PR) diagram. When extra tank volume is available, payload can be traded for
additional fuel once the design range is exceeded. Doing so moves the **second
kink** in the PR diagram—as well as the **ferry‑range point**—to the right.

## Steps from Assignment 5.8
The page lists the tasks for creating a PR diagram:

1. **State the design range and design payload.**
2. **Check for a maximum structural payload requirement.** If one exists,
   report the mass $m_{pl\,max}$ and compute the achievable range at this
   payload.
3. **Compute the ferry range** for $m_{pl}=0$.
4. **Plot the PR diagram** using the results from the previous steps.

## Identifying Key Points
- **Maximum structural payload** corresponds to the highest payload mass the
  aircraft structure is permitted to carry. For fuel‑powered aircraft the
  available fuel with this payload is
  \[m_f = m_{MTO} - m_{OE} - m_{pl\,max}\]【F:Airplane_Design_Part_2.pdf†L1814-L1822】.
  The associated range is found with the Breguet equation, subtracting the
  auxiliary range.
- **Ferry range** is the maximum distance flown with no payload. It is
  computed by setting $m_{pl}=0$ in the range equation while using the same
  fuel mass as for the design condition. The page notes that practical ferry
  range might include the mass of a pilot if one is required to fly the
  aircraft【F:Airplane_Design_Part_2.pdf†L1725-L1755】.

Use these points—design payload, any maximum structural payload, and ferry
range—to sketch the complete payload–range diagram.
