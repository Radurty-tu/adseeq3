# Aspect Ratio Choice (Part 2 pp. 82–83)

Part 2 emphasises that the wing aspect ratio $A_w$ is a key design parameter. A large
aspect ratio decreases lift‑induced drag, improving the maximum lift‑to‑drag ratio
in Eq. (5.12), but it also makes the wing slender and structurally heavy. Lower
aspect ratio wings are lighter yet suffer more induced drag. Because the trade‑off
cannot be quantified at this early stage, designers are advised to inspect
reference aircraft to see which aspect ratios are feasible.

**Assignment guidance (5.1):**
1. Compute $A_w=b^2/S$ for each reference aircraft using their wing span $b$ and
   reference area $S$.
2. Choose an aspect ratio for your design and justify it by comparing with the
   reference aircraft values.
3. Discuss how your choice is expected to influence induced drag, wing mass and
   the internal volume for fuel/systems.

This qualitative reasoning helps pick a practical value before detailed structural
analysis is available.
