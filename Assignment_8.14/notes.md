# Assignment 8.14 – Selecting a Turbofan Nacelle Type

Part 3 p.219 describes three nacelle configurations. Type A is meant for turbojet engines and is not considered for turbofan installations. The two relevant types for turbofans are:

- **Type B** – a full-length nacelle that encloses both the fan bypass flow and the gas‑turbine core. The bypass and core flows mix ahead of the nozzle, improving thrust-specific fuel consumption and reducing noise. The downside is a larger wetted surface and therefore more friction drag.
- **Type C** – a split design consisting of a shorter fan cowl combined with a separate core cowl. This exposes part of the engine core, decreasing wetted area compared with Type B. However, without forced mixing it may not reduce noise and fuel burn as effectively.

Both configurations assume an axisymmetric approximation in the textbook, even though real nacelles are slightly drooped. Choosing between Type B or Type C involves balancing drag versus mixing/noise advantages.
