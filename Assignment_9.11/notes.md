# Final Three-View Clean-Up (Part 3 p. 272)

Summary of guidelines for refining the final three-view drawing:

- **Include axes**: Every view (top, front, side) should show its own axis system.
- **Top view clean up**:
  - Remove wing lines hidden inside the fuselage; only show the exposed wing.
  - Mark spar locations and landing gear wheels; show retracted wheels if applicable.
  - Indicate the wing mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) on the centerline and add the forward and aft CG positions.
  - Delineate the bounds of reference wing area $S_w$ and tailplane area $S_h$.
  - Draw front and aft pressure bulkheads for pressurized cabins.
  - Add visible emergency exit locations.
- **Front view details**:
  - Draw vertical and horizontal tails, adding a small dihedral angle for low‑tail layouts.
  - If a yehudi step is present, thicken the inner wing in front view.
  - Show deployed landing gear and its stowed position if retractable.
  - Include the passenger floor with thickness.
- **Side view details**:
  - Ensure the wing (and yehudi step if present) is properly drawn; only show external portions of wing and horizontal tail.
  - Show MAC of the vertical tail and the vertical tail area $S_v$.
  - Mark emergency exits, landing gear (and stowed position if any), pressure bulkheads, passenger floor and pilot’s eye.
- **Overall**: Indicate the stowed landing gear positions, depict reference areas with shading or light hash marks, draw MAC lines for wing and tail surfaces, add a scale bar, and include a ground plane in the side view.
