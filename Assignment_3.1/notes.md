# Assignment 3.1 – Payload Related Requirements

The textbook *Airplane Design Part 1* (pp. 18–20) describes how to establish the payload requirement before sizing the aircraft. The passage emphasizes that the payload definition strongly affects the fuselage size and overall mass.

Average passenger data collected at European airports in 2022:

- 76 kg passenger mass
- 8 kg carry-on luggage mass
- 16 kg checked luggage mass (bounded by airline allowances such as 23 kg)

This results in an average payload of **100 kg per passenger**.

To estimate luggage and cargo volumes, the book suggests placeholder densities:

- Luggage density $\rho_{\text{luggage}} \approx 170\;\mathrm{kg/m^3}$
- Cargo density $\rho_{\text{cargo}} \approx 160\;\mathrm{kg/m^3}$

## Assignment instructions (Part 1, pp. 18‑20)

### a. Maximum‑capacity condition

1. How many passengers are required to be transported?
2. What is the mass of the passengers plus their luggage?
3. How are the passengers divided among different classes?
4. What seat width and seat pitch do you require?
5. How many cubic meters of luggage do you need?
6. How much volume is required in the cabin for carry‑on luggage?
7. How much volume is needed in a cargo hold for luggage?
8. What is the cargo mass?
9. How much cargo volume is required?
10. What is the maximum structural payload mass?

### b. Design condition (*skip if identical to the maximum‑capacity condition*)

1. How many passengers are required to be transported?
2. What is the mass of the passengers plus their luggage?
3. How are the passengers divided among different classes?
4. What seat width and seat pitch do you require?
5. How many cubic meters of luggage do you need to transport?
6. How much volume is required in the cabin for carry‑on luggage?
7. How much volume is needed in a cargo hold for luggage?
8. How much cargo volume is required?
9. What is the cargo mass?
10. What is the design payload mass?

These questions form the basis for defining your top‑level payload requirements before proceeding to mission and performance calculations.
