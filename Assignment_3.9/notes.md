# Reference Aircraft Selection Notes

This summary is based on Part 1, pp. 50–52, which discuss how to pick suitable reference aircraft at the start of the design process.

## Why use reference aircraft?
* To make initial assumptions before analysis results are available.
* Choose aircraft with similar Top Level Aircraft Requirements (TLARs) to your design.
* Newer aircraft usually have technology closer to what you need; older aircraft may provide historical context but might not match modern technology.
* Typically select 5–10 aircraft; more recent examples take priority when available.

## Example from the text
The book illustrates selecting five regional airliners (~50 passengers, range ≈ 1000 km) as reference aircraft:
ATR 42‑600, Antonov An‑148, Bombardier CRJ700, De Havilland Canada Dash 8 Q400, and Fokker 50.

## Recommended data to collect for each reference
* **Manufacturer**
* **Aircraft name**
* **Entry‑into‑service year**
* **Number of passengers**
* **Maximum payload mass (kg)**
* **Maximum range (km or nmi)**
* **Maximum take‑off mass (MTOM)**
* **Empty mass or operating empty mass (OEM)**
* **Wing area (m²)**
* **Wing span (m)**
* **Maximum take‑off power or thrust**
* **Photo** showing the aircraft

## Pros and cons of different references
* **Newer aircraft** – closer to current technology and regulations.
* **Older aircraft** – may differ in available technology but can offer additional examples if modern references are scarce.
* Prioritize aircraft that best match your TLARs, even if passenger count or range is slightly different.

## Plotting OEM vs. MTOM
The assignment suggests creating a diagram with operating empty mass (OEM) on the vertical axis and maximum take‑off mass (MTOM) on the horizontal axis, plotting each reference aircraft as a point. This helps visualize how your selected references compare in terms of mass distribution.
