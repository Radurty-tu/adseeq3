# Landing Gear Integration in Side View (Part 3 p.255)

- **Step 1** – Determine the required tip‑over angle (often around 15°) and the
  allowable scrape angle (about 12° in the example).
- **Step 2** – Set the minimum nose‑gear load fraction for steering
  (\(f_{\text{nlg,min}} \ge 0.06\)) and a maximum fraction to be
  supported structurally (typically 0.15–0.20).
- **Step 3** – Choose the fuselage pitch angle on the ground
  (\(\theta_{\text{fus}}\)).
- **Step 4** – In the side view, draw constraint lines for the chosen
  tip‑over and scrape angles (and any ground‑clearance limits) to position
  the main gear. The intersection of these lines usually gives the shortest
  and most forward location.
- **Step 5** – Draw the ground plane below the tire.
- **Step 6** – Draw constraint lines based on nose‑gear load requirements
  to locate the nose gear. Any position between the limits is acceptable;
  a forward location reduces load but increases turn radius.
- **Step 7** – If applicable, sketch retraction paths for the main and
  nose gear.

After placing the wheels, verify in the drawing that the tip‑over and scrape
angles are met. Measuring the tip‑over angle relative to a vertical line is
sufficient when the fuselage is level. A simple line from the lowest point of
the tire provides a useful approximation to check the scrape angle.
Keeping the reference \(X\)-axis below the ground plane ensures all
\(Z\)-coordinates remain positive if the gear height changes later.
