# Wing Configuration Choice (Part 2 p. 68)

This page discusses the three main wing positions described on p. 68 of Part 2 and gives initial reasoning on which to adopt for our design.

## High‑Wing
**Advantages**
- Fuselage can be close to the ground, easing cargo loading/unloading.
- Engines sit higher above the ground, reducing risk of debris or water ingestion.
- Landing gear may be fuselage mounted so the aircraft can "kneel" for ramps.
- Provides greater lateral stability in sideslip.

**Disadvantages**
- Wing‑mounted main gear would be tall; fuselage‑mounted gear requires external sponsons, increasing drag and mass.
- Wing is high off the ground, making inspection and fueling more difficult.

## Low‑Wing
**Advantages**
- Short, wide‑track landing gear integrated directly in the wing box for low weight and drag.
- Easy access to wing and engines for fueling or maintenance.
- Common choice for passenger aircraft, so airport servicing equipment exists.

**Disadvantages**
- Fuselage sits higher from the ground; often needs stairs or lifts for boarding and cargo.
- Lower lateral stability (can be offset with wing dihedral).
- Ground clearance for engines or propellers may require taller gear or fuselage‑mounted engines.

## Mid‑Wing
**Advantages**
- Little or no wing‑body fairing is needed, minimizing friction drag.
- Wing‑body blending reduces aerodynamic interference.
- Lateral stability unaffected; good pilot visibility.

**Disadvantages**
- Difficult structural integration because highest bending loads occur at the wing root.
- For passenger aircraft the wing box would pass through the cabin; alternatively the wing must be behind the cabin, complicating balance.
- Engine inlet ducts may interfere with wing structure on combat aircraft.

## Initial Choice for the Project
Our top‑level requirements (e.g. around 87 passengers and a 2100 km design range) suggest a regional passenger transport. For such aircraft, a low‑wing layout offers efficient landing‑gear integration and straightforward engine installation while keeping drag and weight down. Although a high‑wing improves lateral stability and ground clearance, the added structural drag and servicing complications make it less attractive. A mid‑wing would complicate the fuselage structure. Therefore the **low‑wing** configuration is the most suitable starting point for our project.
