# Cruise-Speed Constraint Curve (Part 3, pp. 160-161)

- The thrust-to-weight ratio required to meet the cruise speed can be plotted as a curve on the matching diagram. 
- For the aircraft to satisfy this requirement, its thrust-to-weight ratio for any given wing loading must lie above this curve.
- Lower wing loadings demand higher thrust (or power) to maintain cruise speed at altitude, due in part to engine thrust lapse with altitude.
- **Assignment 7.5 tasks:**
  1. Using the cruise conditions from Assignment 7.4, determine the engine lapse ratio \(\alpha_P\) or \(\alpha_T\).
  2. If a cruise Mach number is specified, compute the cruise speed \(V_{CR}\) with equation (7.30).
  3. Tabulate power loading or thrust-to-weight ratio versus wing loading, following the method in Example 7.5.
  4. Plot the resulting cruise-speed constraint curve on the matching diagram.
