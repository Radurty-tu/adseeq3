# Airworthiness Regulations – Summary (Part 1 pp. 31–33)

These pages discuss how to determine which set of airworthiness requirements apply at the start of a new aircraft project. The applicable code (e.g. CS‑23 or CS‑25) drives the entire certification process, so defining the certification basis early is vital.

## Key Criteria

1. **Weight of the aircraft** – The take‑off mass determines whether the design falls in the “Large Airplane” scope of CS‑25 or the smaller airplane categories covered by CS‑23.
2. **Number of passengers** – Passenger capacity is another factor in selecting the appropriate category. Larger passenger numbers typically push the design towards CS‑25.
3. **Powerplant type** – Whether the airplane has piston engines, turboprops or turbofan engines influences which regulation is applicable. For example, a twin turbofan transport with many seats qualifies as a CS‑25 large airplane.

For light aircraft, EASA’s CS‑VLA or CS‑LSA may apply, imposing fewer tests and lower costs than CS‑23. A short‑range two‑seater may therefore be certified under CS‑VLA, while aircraft like the Pipistrel Velis Electro or Cirrus SF‑50 are examples within CS‑23 categories. Larger transports such as the Embraer E190E2 fall under CS‑25.

## Structure of the Regulations

Each code consists of two books:

- **Book 1 (Airworthiness Code)** – Contains all mandatory requirements, organized in subparts for the aircraft structure, equipment, powerplant, etc.
- **Book 2 (Acceptable Means of Compliance)** – Offers guidance on how to demonstrate compliance with each requirement in Book 1.

The combination of these documents forms the certification basis. With hundreds or thousands of requirements possible, designers must identify at the outset which specific regulations apply.
