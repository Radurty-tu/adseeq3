# Notes on Front and Side Wing Views

## Source
Airplane Design Part 3, p. 217 (section 8.1.7)

## Key Ideas
- Once the wing's thickness-to-chord ratio and dihedral angle are chosen, draw front and side views using the American three‑view convention.
- **Step 1:** Determine wing root thickness from the thickness ratio. In front view, show the root as a line. In side view, sketch an airfoil using the root chord and thickness.
- **Step 2:** Through the root centerline, draw a dashed line for the dihedral angle extending the wing span.
- **Step 3:** Measure the vertical displacement of the tip (Δzᵀ) in front view. Using the thickness ratio, sketch the tip airfoil in side view and mark its position in front view.
- **Step 4:** Connect the leading and trailing edges between root and tip in side view. In front view, connect the top and bottom edges of the root and tip profiles.

### Example 8.5 Highlights
- Root thickness 60 cm for t/c = 10.5 %.
- Dihedral angle Γ = 5°, higher than Example 8.4 due to engine mounting.
- Tip vertical displacement Δzᵀ = 1.3 m, tip thickness 0.19 m.
- Final views show connected profiles in front and side projections.

### Assignment 8.8 Instructions
Add front and side views to your wing drawing from Assignment 8.3.
Follow the American convention and keep the same scale.
