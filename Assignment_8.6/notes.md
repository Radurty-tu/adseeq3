# Thickness-to-Chord Ratio Selection (Part 3 p. 206)

* **Structural Benefits**
  * Higher thickness-to-chord ratio increases bending stiffness, reducing required skin or spar cap area.
  * Allows more internal volume for landing gear, fuel, and systems, leading to lower wing mass.
* **Aerodynamic Considerations**
  * Thicker wings increase form drag; zero-lift drag correlates with thickness-to-chord ratio.
  * Stall characteristics impose limits: very thick or very thin airfoils reduce the maximum lift coefficient.
  * For swept wings at high Mach numbers, thickness must be limited to avoid strong shock formation.
* **Recommended Approach**
  1. Use the zero-lift drag budget to compute the maximum allowable t/c via the form-drag correlation.
  2. Determine minimum and maximum t/c from lift requirements using airfoil data (Fig.Â 8.9).
  3. At cruise Mach numbers above 0.65, further restrict t/c using the wave-drag relation.
  4. Choose the highest t/c that satisfies all constraints to maximize structural volume and minimize mass.
* **Iteration**
  * If no single t/c satisfies drag and lift budgets, either compromise between minimum and maximum values or revisit earlier assumptions (e.g., reduce required CL_max or adjust friction coefficient).
