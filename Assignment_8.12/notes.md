# Notes on Wing-Mounted Propeller Fairings (Part 3 p. 214)

- When a fairing is added around wing-mounted engines, a sizable volume forms behind the engine. Designers may allocate this space for functions such as baggage or fuel storage.
- In the example, the fairing's trailing edge is kept horizontal because the engine envelope is wider than it is tall, though its exact shape can be adjusted aesthetically.
- Integrating electric motors with the wing uses the same steps as piston engines. All guidelines for propeller-wing integration from p. 212 remain valid. With smaller electric motor envelopes, ensure enough distance between the leading edge and the propeller disk.
- Turboshaft engines can also follow piston-engine integration guidelines. Example 8.13 illustrates mounting turboshafts on a high‑wing transport aircraft.
- For the example, inboard engines are positioned so their envelopes touch the front spar while maintaining a clearance of **0.15 Dp** from the fuselage side to the propeller tip.
