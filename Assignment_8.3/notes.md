# Assignment 8.3 Notes

Summary of instructions from Part 3 p. 190 about drawing the wing planform:

- Determine the wing planform geometry using the chosen aspect ratio, quarter-chord sweep angle and taper ratio.
- Compute wing span, root chord and tip chord using the wing area.
- Draw the wing planform in top view:
  1. Draw the root chord and span line.
  2. Add the quarter-chord sweep line.
  3. Draw the tip chord and connect leading and trailing edges to complete the trapezoidal planform.
- **Assignment 8.3** specifically instructs to sketch the planform (one half wing is allowed) at the **same scale** used for the fuselage top view (Assignment 6.3) and side view (Assignment 6.4).
