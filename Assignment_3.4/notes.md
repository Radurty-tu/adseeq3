# Flight-Phase Requirements Summary (Part 1, pp.27-30)

These pages introduce how to derive **Top-Level Aircraft Requirements (TLARs)** from the mission profile. Figure 3.1 in the text provides a typical transport-aircraft mission and is used to extract specific performance targets for each phase. The resulting requirements offer measurable criteria for verifying the design.

## Take‑Off
Questions to define this phase:
1. What runway length is assumed?
2. At what altitude and ambient temperature must take‑off occur?
3. What surface conditions (paved/unpaved, wet/dry) are considered?

*Example placeholder:* 2.5 km paved runway at sea level, ISA +15 °C.

## Climb
Questions to define this phase:
1. What climb rate or gradient is required?
2. At which altitude and speed should this be achieved?
3. At what mass fraction (e.g. % of MTOM) is the requirement evaluated?

*Example placeholder:* 1 m/s at top‑of‑climb around 35 000 ft (ISA +10 °C) with 98 % of MTOM.

## Cruise
Questions to define this phase:
1. What cruise Mach number or true airspeed is required?
2. At which cruise altitude and temperature offset?
3. What mission range does the cruise segment cover?

*Example placeholder:* Mach 0.8 at 35 000 ft, ISA +5 °C, nominal range 3 000 km.

## Landing
Questions to define this phase:
1. What landing distance is permissible and on what runway type?
2. At what altitude and atmospheric conditions must landing performance be met?
3. Are specific weather scenarios (e.g. wet or icy runway) considered?

*Example placeholder:* Land on a 2.9 km paved runway at sea level in all‑weather conditions.

## Key Idea
For each phase, quantifying altitude and temperature conditions ensures the TLARs are specific and measurable. These placeholders should be replaced by project‑specific data once available.
