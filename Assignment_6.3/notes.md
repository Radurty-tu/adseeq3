# Fuselage Top View Design Notes

Summary of Part 3 p.128 describing how to draw the fuselage in top view.

## Key Ideas
- Minimize drag while keeping an adequate tail arm.
- Fuselage top view has three parts: nose cone, cylindrical section, and tail cone.

## Design Sequence
1. **Compute cabin length** from seating layout.
2. **Select**:
   - nose length `l_n`
   - tail-cone slenderness ratio `l_tc/d_fus`
   - tail-to-tail-cone ratio `l_t/l_tc`
   Then compute fuselage length `l_fus`.
3. Determine the drawing scale based on `l_fus` and paper size.
4. Draw fuselage length.
5. Draw fuselage width from cross-section.
6. Choose nose-cone slenderness ratio `l_nc/d_fus` and draw nose and tail cone bounds.
7. Construct fuselage perimeter in top view.
8. Draw the aft cabin wall.

## Parameters and Placeholder Values
Using the four‑seat reference aircraft from Example 6.5 as a starting point:
- `l_n` ≈ 3.0 m
- `l_nc/d_fus` ≈ 1.4
- `l_tc/d_fus` ≈ 3.1
- `l_t/l_tc` ≈ 0.8

These values act as placeholders until dimensions from the chosen reference aircraft are measured.
