# Wing Positioning with Mass Fractions (Part 3 p.241)

Part 3 outlines a simplified method to locate the wing on the fuselage by
examining how payload and fuel masses shift the aircraft's center of gravity
(CG).  The approach normalizes all masses by the maximum take‑off mass so the
results apply to any airplane size.

**Summary of the procedure:**

1. **Group components** into wing and fuselage assemblies.
2. **Estimate weight fractions** of each component statistically.
3. **Compute assembly CGs** for the wing and fuselage.
4. **Select the desired OEM CG** position relative to the mean aerodynamic
   chord (MAC).
5. **Solve for the LEMAC position** in the fuselage reference frame so the OEM
   CG lies at the chosen fraction of the MAC.
6. **Determine payload and fuel CGs** – e.g. assume fuel CG at 15 % MAC if it is
   in the wings.
7. **Construct a simplified loading diagram** that plots CG location vs.
   mass fraction for key loading cases: OEM, OEM + payload, OEM + payload + fuel,
   and OEM + fuel.
8. **Estimate the vertical CG position**, often kept on the fuselage centerline.

By plotting these points, the forward and aft CG limits become evident. The wing
position—expressed by the LEMAC station—is adjusted so these limits fall within
acceptable bounds for stability and landing gear placement.
