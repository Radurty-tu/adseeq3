# Mission Profile Derivation (Part 1 pp.20-22)

Part 1 describes how a mission profile is used to derive top-level aircraft requirements. The mission profile plots altitude against distance and shows each phase of flight, starting with taxi and ending with landing. Example 3.3 illustrates a typical transport-airplane mission profile and lists the resulting requirements. Example 3.4 does the same for a high‑altitude reconnaissance airplane.

### Drawing the mission profile
1. Draw a two‑dimensional graph with distance on the horizontal axis and altitude on the vertical axis.
2. Sketch the following sequence:
   - Taxi and take‑off at the origin.
   - Climb to cruise altitude and cruise to destination (nominal range).
   - Descent and approach to the destination.
   - Diversion leg from the destination to an alternate airport.
   - Loiter (holding pattern) before landing.
3. Label each mission leg (taxi, take‑off, climb, cruise, descent, diversion cruise, loiter, land + taxi) as in Figure 3.1.

### Requirements extracted from Example 3.3
- **Nominal range:** 3,000 km.
- **Diversion range:** 400 km.
- **Loiter time:** 30 minutes at the alternate airport before landing.

### Assignment 3.2 tasks
- Draw and annotate the mission profile as outlined above.
- State the required nominal range, diversion range and loiter time for the design payload.
