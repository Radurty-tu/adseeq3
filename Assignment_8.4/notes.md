# Notes on Marking the Mean Aerodynamic Chord

Summary of Part 3, p.192: how to mark the mean aerodynamic chord (MAC) on the wing drawing.

1. After defining the wing planform, draw the **50%-chord line** across the wing.
2. From the trailing edge of the root, extend the root chord by a tip-chord length. Likewise extend the tip chord forward by one root-chord length.
3. Connect these extension points diagonally. At the intersection with the 50%-chord line, draw the MAC from leading to trailing edge.
4. Copy the MAC to the symmetry plane of the aircraft to show the full-wing MAC. The leading edge position of the MAC (LEMAC) and its length are important references for later layout steps.
5. This graphical approach works for all straightâ€‘tapered wings and effectively represents the wing in one dimension.

These steps are derived from the book's explanation and match the process in Figure 8.7.
