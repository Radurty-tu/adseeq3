Summary of Part 3 p. 251 - Selecting Tire Pressure and Updating ACR
===============================================================

- **Tire pressure limits** are tied to runway surface. Table 9.2 lists maximum
  allowable pressures for surfaces ranging from soft sand to pavement. On paved
  runways most aircraft operate between **0.50 and 1.75 MPa**, which maps to
  classification ratings **X or Y** in the ACR system.
- **Assignment 9.5** asks to choose the tire pressure using the runway type and
  the current ACR's fourth entry (**G4**). If the pressure selection changes
  the classification, the ACR must be updated accordingly.
- The **tire selection process** (beginning of Section 9.2.2) involves:
  1. Selecting tire pressure based on surface type or PCR and updating the ACR
     if required.
  2. Determining the wheel loads for main and nose/tail gear.
  3. Choosing the smallest tire that can handle those loads at the selected
     pressure.
- **Example 9.5** illustrates this. For a PCR of **W** (no explicit maximum
  pressure), a practical value of **1.40â€¯MPa** is selected. The ACR at
  maximum take-off mass is updated to **850/F/C/X/T**.
