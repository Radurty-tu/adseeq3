# Minimum-Speed Constraint Notes

This note summarizes the steps from Airplane Design Part 3 on how to include a minimum-speed requirement in the matching diagram.

1. **Specify the speed requirement** – Begin with the stall or approach speed from Assignment 3.6. Record the altitude `h`, temperature deviation `ΔT`, and mass ratio `β` associated with this requirement.
2. **Determine maximum wing loading** – Use the minimum-speed requirement to calculate the allowable take-off wing loading `W_TO/S_w`.
3. **Choose diagram bounds** – Set suitable limits for the matching diagram. Select an upper bound for wing loading and a bound for thrust-to-weight or power loading as applicable.
4. **Set up the matching diagram** – Prepare the axes using the chosen bounds and plot other constraints as needed.
5. **Draw the minimum-speed line** – Plot the constraint line that enforces the stall or approach speed. Mark the infeasible region on the diagram.

Altitude and temperature affect air density, so if the speed requirement is given for non‑standard conditions you must account for the resulting density when calculating wing loading.
