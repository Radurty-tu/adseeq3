# Landing Gear Layout Decision (Part 2 p.69)

Part 2 discusses two main landing gear arrangements and gives guidance on how to choose
between them. The assignment on page 69 asks which layout you select and where you
will attach the landing gear to the airframe.

## Conventional or "tail-dragger" landing gear
- Main wheels are ahead of the center of gravity with a small tail wheel.
- Allows three-point or tail-wheel landings that reduce speed quickly thanks to the
  nose-high attitude.
- High propeller clearance during taxiing.
- Drawbacks: poor forward visibility while taxiing, increased drag during take-off
  until the tail lifts, possibility to bounce in a two-wheel landing, and risk of
  nose-over or ground loop because the center of gravity is behind the main gear.

## Tricycle landing gear
- Places the center of gravity ahead of the main gear, preventing ground loops and
  nose-overs.
- Keeps the aircraft level on the ground for lower drag and easier passenger and
  cargo loading.
- Good over-the-nose visibility and tends to place the nose wheel firmly on the
  runway after a hard landing.
- Heavier than a tail wheel because the nose gear must carry high loads and the
  airframe requires local reinforcement at the nose gear attachment.

## Attachment points
- Structural frames in the fuselage provide attachment points for the wing, tail
  and possibly the landing gear. Some frames are strengthened with plates and act
  as bulkheads to distribute concentrated loads.

## Retractable vs. fixed gear (placeholder)
- The text continues with a discussion on whether the landing gear should retract
  or remain fixed. A retractable system lowers drag but adds mass, complexity and
  maintenance requirements. Further analysis is needed for our design choice.
