The textbook recommends placing the front spar at 20% of chord and the rear spar at 70%. These two spars form the sides of the wing box, a volume that can be used for fuel storage. Placing high‑lift devices outside the box leaves this space clear. The rear spar position is critical for the main landing gear integration, while the front spar location must accommodate any wing‑mounted engines or motors.
