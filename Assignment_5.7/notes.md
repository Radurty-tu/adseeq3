# Assignment 5.7 Notes

This section (Part 2, pp. 100–102) introduces **Assignment 5.7**, which asks you to calculate the characteristic masses of your airplane and then plot the result on the reference diagram from Assignment 3.9.

## Tasks

1. **Compute Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM)** – determine the total mass at take-off based on payload, empty mass and energy mass.
2. **Compute (Operating) Empty Mass (OEM)** – estimate the mass of the structure, installed systems and any operational items such as crew and catering.
3. **Compute Energy Mass in the Design Condition** – quantify how much fuel or battery mass is needed to fly the design mission.
4. **Compute Reserve Energy Mass** – determine the additional energy mass needed for contingencies (diversion, holding, etc.).
5. **Plot on Reference Diagram** – place your aircraft’s point on the Assignment 3.9 diagram and compare it with the reference aircraft data.

## Context

After obtaining these values you can gauge where your design sits relative to regulations (e.g. CS/FAR 23 limits) and you can proceed with subsequent sizing and performance analysis. The text emphasizes keeping track of earlier design choices—such as energy carrier, aspect ratio and propulsion system—because they influence your mass estimates and the overall design process.
