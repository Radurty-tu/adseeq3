Summary of instructions for sizing the horizontal tailplane and integrating it into the three-view drawing.

## Horizontal Tailplane Design
- Select a longitudinal location for the horizontal tail aerodynamic center relative to the fuselage reference frame.
- Measure the tail arm $l_h$ between the wing aerodynamic center and the tail aerodynamic center.
- Choose an appropriate tail volume coefficient $V_h$ and compute the horizontal tail area $S_h$.
- Decide on the planform parameters (aspect ratio $A_h$, taper ratio $\lambda_h$, and quarter-chord sweep $\Lambda_{h,c/4}$).
- From these parameters determine the span, root chord, tip chord and mean aerodynamic chord of the horizontal tail.
- Add the horizontal tail to the top, front and side views of the drawing.

## Tuning the Three-View Drawing
- Remove hidden wing lines inside the fuselage; keep only the visible portion.
- Include spar locations and landing gear wheels, showing stowed wheels if retractable.
- Mark the wing mean aerodynamic chord on the centerline along with forward and aft CG limits.
- Indicate boundaries of reference wing and horizontal tail areas, plus pressure bulkheads and emergency exits where visible.
- In the front view, show the vertical and horizontal tails. If the design has a low tail, a small dihedral can prevent tail scraping when rotating.
- Apply any yehudi step to the wing thickness in the front view and only show the portion of the wing outside the fuselage in the side view. The same rule applies to the horizontal tail.
- Depict the vertical tail mean aerodynamic chord in the side view and adjust the drawing for proper wing root profile if a yehudi is used.
