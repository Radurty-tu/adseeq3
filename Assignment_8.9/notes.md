# Notes on Propeller Diameter Sizing

This summary is based on Part 3, p. 205–206 (original numbering) of the course text.

The text explains that propeller noise and efficiency depend strongly on the diameter and rotational speed. To estimate the propeller diameter for a tractor configuration, Ref. [12]'s method is modified, resulting in equation (8.14):

```
Dp = 0.554 * sqrt(P_TO / (1000 * N_e))
```

where:
- `Dp` is the propeller diameter in meters,
- `P_TO` is the take‑off power in kW, and
- `N_e` is the number of engines or motors.

The formula gives a first estimate for tractor propeller diameter. A survey of civil and military propeller aircraft shows most propellers fall within about ±5 % of the prediction; military examples may be underestimated by up to 15 %.

**Example 8.6** evaluates the formula for a 152 kW single‑engine airplane, yielding a diameter of approximately 1.9 m.

**Assignment 8.9** instructs students to apply this method to their own aircraft designs to determine the propeller diameter.
